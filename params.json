{"name":"Musicat","tagline":"Simple music player for android","body":"### Goals\r\n+ Musicat is an open source software and it will remain free for the rest of my life. I hope that someone will help me to improve the app\r\n\r\n+ Musicat try to add some feautures that I did not see in other similar apps\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Floating Bubble\r\nInspired by faceCook app (I hate facebook app :) , I implemented a floating bubble to manage basic action of music player. You can show or hide the bubble in settings. By default it is active.\r\nHow to use:\r\n+ Long press:      you can drag on screen\r\n+ Release finger:  now gestures are enable\r\n+ Swipe right:     skip to next song\r\n+ Swipe up:        play/pause current track       \r\n***\r\n\r\n### Real Image Editing (Art Work)\r\nLike other id3x tag, you can edit title, album, artist and image. App offers you the possibility to search an image form a web service. From my stats a title like \"This is title_-_(HD) original_video feat xxx\" corresponds at 90% to the searched image. If not, I'm so sorry.\r\nTo improve speed of scroling I did chose to show art work from MediaStore. This means that correct image will show itself after a reboot or an automatic media resfresh caused from google play music or similar app. But editing of an image of a track causes the change immediatly into the file. Copy and paste the file on your pc to see.\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Web server for player\r\nYou can listen music from your pc or any other devices that support wifi (this devices must be connected to the same network).\r\nTo run server, go to the settings and enable \"Web server\".  Musicat will show to you IP used\". Open your favorite  browser and put the local url. Musicat use port 8080. Tested on network with a normal firewall. Is not necessary to open the port\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Others Feautures\r\n+ Edit metatag, like title, artist and album and also Album Art Image\r\n+ Shake the phone to skip the song\r\n+ Customize with dark or light theme, and set different colors\r\n\r\n### Coming Soon\r\n+ Fix bugs\r\n+ Add a queue\r\n+ Add count a countdown\r\n+ Implement an automatic image editing but for now google offers a low number of requests\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nSend me an email to _diego.tonini93@gmail.com_\r\n\r\n### Screenshoot\r\n![](https://github.com/multivoltage/Musicat/blob/gh-pages/img/Screenshot_2015-09-20-15-43-58.png)\r\n![](https://github.com/multivoltage/Musicat/blob/gh-pages/img/Screenshot_2015-09-20-15-44-13.png)\r\n![](https://github.com/multivoltage/Musicat/blob/gh-pages/img/Screenshot_2015-09-20-15-44-26.png)\r\n![](https://github.com/multivoltage/Musicat/blob/gh-pages/img/Screenshot_2015-09-20-15-44-41.png)\r\n![](https://github.com/multivoltage/Musicat/blob/gh-pages/img/Screenshot_2015-09-20-15-45-10.png)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
